I"à<p>First published in 1891, Pellegrino Artusiâ€™sÂ La scienza in cucina e lâ€™arte di mangier beneÂ has come to be recognized as the most significant Italian cookbook of modern times.</p>

<p>It was reprinted thirteen times and had sold more than 52,000 copies in the years before Artusiâ€™s death in 1910, with the number of recipes growing from 475 to 790. And while this figure has not changed, the book has consistently remained in print.</p>

<p>Although Artusi was himself of the upper classes and it was doubtful he had ever touched a kitchen utensil or lit a fire under a pot, he wrote the book not for professional chefs, as was the nineteenth-century custom, but for middle-class family cooks: housewives and their domestic helpers.</p>

<p>His tone is that of a friendly advisor - humorous and nonchalant. He indulges in witty anecdotes about many of the recipes, describing his experiences and the historical relevance of particular dishes.</p>

<p>Artusiâ€™s masterpiece is not merely a popular cookbook; it is a landmark work in Italian culture. This English edition (first published by Marsilio Publishers in 1997) features a delightful introduction by Luigi Ballerini that traces the fascinating history of the book and explains its importance in the context of Italian history and politics.</p>
