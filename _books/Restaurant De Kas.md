In 2001, Gert Jan Hageman decided to repurpose the Amsterdam Municipal Greenhouse building – which had been nominated for demolition – and convert it into a restaurant. Soon after, De Kas became one of the first farm-to-table restaurants in the world.

Since then, more than fifty thousand guests a year have enjoyed lunch or dinner in the spectacular dining room, designed by Piet Boon. In 2018, Wim de Beer and Jos Timmer took over the reins and decided to shift the focus to sustainability and serving exquisite vegetable dishes. The two chefs had worked together in Amsterdam’s Michelin-starred Rijks restaurant, before which De Beer had been a chef at Parkheuvel and Bolenius and Timmer at Vermeer and Jamie Oliver.
